# Decisions

Non-obvious technical decisions, newest first.

## 2026-10-29: Monorepo layout and single Worker deploy
- **Decision:** pnpm workspaces with `apps/client` (Vite + React + Phaser), `apps/server` (Cloudflare Worker) and `packages/shared`. The Worker serves the client build as static assets and handles `/api/*` itself.
- **Why:** one deploy, one URL, shared TypeScript types, and everything stays on the Cloudflare free plan.

## 2026-10-29: `@att/shared` is consumed as TypeScript source
- **Decision:** `packages/shared` exports `src/index.ts` directly; there is no separate build output.
- **Why:** both Vite and Wrangler bundle TypeScript, so a build step for shared code would only add friction.
